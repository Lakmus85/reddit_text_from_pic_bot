# Reddit bot that extracts a text from the posted pictures
Sometimes you remember some phrase from a picture you saw on reddit.  
But neither Reddit nor search engines index the text contained in the pictures.  
So unless you are very lucky, or you've bookmarked/upvoted that picture, you have very little chances of finding it again.  
I'm hoping this little bot will change this!
